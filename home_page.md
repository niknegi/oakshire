   - Link to LinkedIn profiles of team members
   - Display certifications/badges

5. **Clear next steps:**
   - "Schedule a call" with calendar integration (Calendly)
   - "Email us" with direct mailto link
   - "Download case studies" as PDF
   - Live chat for immediate questions

6. **Exit intent popup:** (when user is about to leave)

# FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**Use VERSION 1** for your main homepage—it's bold, metric-driven, and perfect for US/EU audience.

**Keep VERSION 2** as a variant for A/B testing.

**Use VERSION 3** if your primary audience is technical decision-makers (CTOs, VPs of Engineering).

The key is:
1. **Lead with social proof** (Axis Bank, big numbers)
2. **Show, don't tell** (metrics > adjectives)
3. **Clear CTA** (make it easy to contact you)
4. **Build trust** (real projects, real results)

---

**Next Steps:**

1. Choose your version
2. Customize the copy with your company name, contact info
3. Get screenshots from your projects
4. Build it out (or want me to create the actual HTML/React code?)
5. Launch and start A/B testing!
